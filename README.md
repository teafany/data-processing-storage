# Data Processing and Storage

## How to Run:
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Open the project in your editor or navigate to the directory
3. Run the program:
    - **VS Code:** Click the Run button
    - **Command line:** `python3 main.py` or `python main.py`
4. The test cases from the assignment (Fig 2) will execute
5. View the output in the terminal

### Future Assignment Improvements
I considered a few assignment modifications while completing this assignment. It would be helpful to include the expected outputs for the test cases in Figure 2. Knowing the format of error messages could help students verify their implementation. Additionally, while the assignment allows any language, it would be useful if the instruction recommended which languages are best suited for this assignment (though I did notice the Python dictionary resource in the links, which guided my implementation). For more effective grading, providing an automated test script for students to run locally would be great.
